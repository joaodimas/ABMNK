\justify \small \singlespacing
The paper will analyze the characteristics of the main existing macroprudential framework, the Basel accord, in its different versions. The different ways to measure credit, mainly, but also market risk and how it evolved to address different problems, procyclicality being the leading one.  By the same token, the complexity of designing such measures is studied; this is done referring mainly to the empirical findings about the credit risk-taking channel of monetary policy and the rational expectations critique. A further development of the work on macroprudential tightening effects during low interest rate times is suggested.
