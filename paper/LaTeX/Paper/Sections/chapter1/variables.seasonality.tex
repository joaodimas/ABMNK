\myparagraph Adjusting for seasonality
We use the \textit{X-13ARIMA-SEATS Seasonal Adjustment Program}\footnote{Available in R with the package \textit{seasonal}} (hereafter X-13ARIMA-SEATS) offered by the United States Census Bureau to detect and remove the seasonal effects. Specifically, we used the \textit{SEATS} function, which makes the adjustment based on a \textit{seasonal ARIMA} model \footnote{The order of the seasonal ARIMA is chosen according to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)} and shows the significance of dummies for each quarter. Accordingly, we used the adjusted the series in all estimations.
