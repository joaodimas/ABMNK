\subsection{Inflation rate}
This series is calculated by IBGE and available in monthly rate (\% of price index\footnote{The most generally used price index in Brazil is the Índice de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo (IPCA)} change). First we aggregate by quarter (composing the monthly index) and annualize. As a result, our quarterly annualized inflation rate becomes:

\begin{align}
\pi_t = \left[\prod(\pi_t^m+1)\right]^{4}-1

\end{align}
