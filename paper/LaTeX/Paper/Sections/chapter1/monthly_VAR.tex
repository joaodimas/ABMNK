\section{VAR with monthly data}
    This granularity will give us with more degrees of freedom and allow for a larger VAR if desired. Following advice from \citet{Ivanov2005} for the method with the lowest RMSE when comparing impulse responses with the true data generating process in monthly frequency, we chose the lag order according to the Akaike Information Criterion.
    \subsection{Specification}
        Our first specification is composed by \(\pi_t\), \(Y_t\), \(R_t\) in monthly frequency, where \(Y_t\) represents the IBC-br.
