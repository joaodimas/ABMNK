\section{VAR with monthly data}
    We now experiment with a different variable for economic activity. The IBC-br, an index composed of \hl{20 variables}, is calculated by the Central Bank of Brazil and available in monthly frequency. This granularity will give us with more degrees of freedom and allow for a larger VAR if desired.
    \subsection{Specification}
        Our first specification is composed by \(\pi_t\), \(Y_t\), \(R_t\) in monthly frequency, where \(Y_t\) represents the IBC-br.
