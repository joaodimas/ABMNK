\subsection{Economic activity index (IBC-br)}
The IBC-br is an index calculated by the Central Bank of Brazil. It is an aggregate of 21 variables of economic activity. It is intended to be used as an anticipation of the real GDP. We downloaded the series from the Central Bank's website in monthly level, seasonally adjusted. To obtain the quarterly frequency, we averaged the index through the months in each quarter.
