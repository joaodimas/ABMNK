\section{Baseline VAR}
    Starting from the seminal work of \citet{Sims1992}, we build a structural vector autoregressive model using Cholesky decomposition to restrict contemporaneous interactions among the variables. The recursive ordering is necessary to obtain dynamic responses from an exogenous shock---specifically, to assess the effects of a monetary policy shock on the other variables of the system.

VAR monthly with industrial production
The main challenge is that the series starts in 2002.
    - extra variables for robustness check
    - alternative measures of activity
        - ibc-br
            the main challenge is that the series starts in 2003.
        - gdp growth
        - output gap (quarterly data)
