\subsection{Industrial production}
This series is calculated by the Instituto Nacional de Geografia e Estat√≠stica (IBGE) with the name PIM-PF. We have downloaded it from the IBGE's website in monthly \% change, seasonally adjusted. Importantly, though, this series has been modified two times since its conception in 1985. The first modification, in 2004, incorporated data retrospectively up to 1991, with the older series, from 1991 to 2004, being deprecated. The second modification---current version---came to light in 2014, and incorporates data retrospectively up to 2002. As a result, we have three distinct series for different time periods (see \citet{IBGE2015} for detailed methodology): version 1 (from 1985 to 2004), version 2 (from 1991 to 2014), and version 3 (from 2002 onwards). Our estimations used the last version.
