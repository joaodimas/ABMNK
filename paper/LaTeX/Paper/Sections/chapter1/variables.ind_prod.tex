This series is calculated by the Instituto Nacional de Geografia e Estat√≠stica (IBGE). We have downloaded it from the IBGE's website in monthly \% change, seasonally adjusted. To obtain the series in quarterly frequency, we have composed the rate of the months in each quarter, so that the new series represent the total growth rate in each period.
